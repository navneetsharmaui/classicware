			Now user don't just need to buy the branded items from the other e-commerce sites, our web app gives the user best traditional products they always love to buy or wish to buy from another cities. we connect the local vendors around the countries with thier consumer part in metropolitan cities. People livng in metropolitan cities always find it hard to buy traditional local products. They left the thier local cities to live in big cities  but always missed the items they were able to buy in local cities. It's not always about the branded products that people desire for, their is always a desire in persons heart to buy products from their local cities, but not all can go to this cities to buy those products as they are busy with thier work. So, at this point comes our app which provides consumer with the platform to buy those top traditional products.
